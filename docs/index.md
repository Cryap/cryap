Cryap is a [federated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse) social network written in Rust, currently in development. It speaks ActivityPub, which means it can federate with platforms like Mastodon, Pleroma, and others. Cryap also supports the [Mastodon API](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/client/intro), making it compatible with popular clients such as [Semaphore](https://semaphore.social) and [Tusky](https://tusky.app) - and we plan to implement our own frontend too!
## Why another social network?
We plan that Cryap will combine the advantages of all popular ActivityPub microblogging engines. For example:

- Simplicity of Mastodon
- Versatility of Misskey
- Lightness more than Pleroma, because Cryap is written in Rust

We also plan to implement such functionality as [cat ears for avatars](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/18337), articles and much more.
## Status
It is possible to publish posts without media, read them and interact with posts and users. There is support for OAuth2 (but no scopes yet). Soon we will reach a level that allows daily use and we will be able to start developing our own frontend. You can help us achieve this :slight_smile:
